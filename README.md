# GeoColor App ðŸŽ¨

GeoColor is a cross-platform application, which works on the web, iOS and Android devices, so this app will serve as a support for geologists, geological engineers and related careers, as well as students of these careers.

## Introducing to GeoColor functionalities
GeoColor use the power of your device to sweep an image and extract the main colors from it, e.g. we can use it with a rock and extract its main colors and visualize it in different color formats, like the Munsell format which is important in soil and rock classifications.
### Here is a Demo of how to use this feature

#### First open the app and press on the arrow-right ðŸ¡ª

# Color format support

- Munsell Format: A color notation system that defines colors based on hue, value, and chroma. It uses a combination of letters and numbers to represent the color, such as 5R 5/10.
- RGB Format: A color model that defines colors based on the intensities of red, green, and blue light. It uses values between 0 and 255 to represent the intensity of each color, such as RGB(255, 0, 0) for pure red.
- HEX Format: A color model that defines colors based on their hexadecimal code. It uses a six-digit code made up of numbers and letters to represent the intensity of red, green, and blue light, such as #FF0000 for pure red.
